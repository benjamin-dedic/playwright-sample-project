# Test Planning

## Overview

The purpose of this test plan is to ensure comprehensive testing coverage for the Angular application using Playwright. The test suite aims to validate the functionality, usability, and performance of the application across different scenarios.

## Objectives

- Validate the login functionality with correct and incorrect credentials.
- Verify the presentation of account sections and balances on the dashboard.
- Test the behavior of the application when the dashboard is empty.
- Ensure that links on the login page redirect to the correct URLs.
- Validate error messages and warning texts displayed throughout the application.

## Test Scope

The test scope includes:

- Login functionality
- Dashboard presentation
- Account sections and balances
- Empty dashboard scenario
- Error handling and warning messages
- Navigation links

## Test Strategy

### Automated Testing

- Utilize Playwright for automated end-to-end testing.
- Create test scripts to cover various scenarios based on user interactions.
- Implement page object model (POM) for better maintainability and readability.
- Use environment variables to parameterize test data and configurations.

### Manual Testing

- Perform exploratory testing to uncover potential issues not covered by automated tests.
- Test on different browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- Validate responsive design and layout on various screen sizes.
- Verify accessibility features and compliance with accessibility standards.

## Test Cases

1. **Login Functionality**
   - Test with valid credentials.
   - Test with invalid username/password.
   - Test with missing username/password.
   - Verify error messages for invalid credentials.

2. **Dashboard Presentation**
   - Validate the presence of account sections.
   - Verify the display of balances for each account section.
   - Ensure the correctness of currency conversion.

3. **Empty Dashboard Scenario**
   - Test behavior when no accounts are available.
   - Verify the display of appropriate messages.

4. **Navigation Links**
   - Test links on the login page for "Smart" and "Direct" URLs.
   - Validate redirection to the correct URLs.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Verify the display of error messages for failed API requests.
   - Test error handling for unexpected scenarios.

## Test Execution

- Execute automated tests in CI/CD pipelines after each code change.
- Run manual tests on staging and production environments before deployment.
- Perform regression testing after bug fixes or new feature implementations.
- Continuously update test cases and scripts to adapt to application changes.

## Reporting

- Generate test reports using Playwright's built-in reporting capabilities.
- Include detailed information about test results, including passed, failed, and skipped tests.
- Attach screenshots or videos for visual validation of test execution.
